# Clicker game
The gameplay revolves around the simple act of clicking the cookie to earn cookies. As you accumulate cookies, you can spend them to purchase various upgrades and buildings that automate the cookie generation process. These upgrades and buildings can increase the rate at which cookies are produced, allowing you to earn more cookies even when you're not actively clicking.

This game also features online connectivity and a global leaderboard. By connecting to the server, players can compare their progress and achievements with other players from around the world.

## Roadmap
#### Core Mechanics and UI:
- Develop the basic gameplay mechanics, including cookie clicking and initial upgrades.
- Design and implement the user interface for cookie collection, upgrades, and basic statistics.

#### Develop server-side functionality to connect players and enable global scoreboards.
- Design a user-friendly interface for connecting to the server and viewing the leaderboard.
